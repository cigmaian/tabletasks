Tasks: 

1. Create a table from the data attached to the challenge, feel free to use the <table><table/> html tags, or any other html structure you find appropriate.

2. Create a text input that will filter the existing results of the table

    - The filter action should search in the first name or last name of the user

    - The filter action should be triggered when the user presses the “Enter” key

    - The filter should work with a partial match, meaning that for the user input “jack” it will match both the following “jack” and “jackson”

    - The filter should be case insensitive, meaning that for the user input “eugene” it should match both the following “EUGENE” and “EuGeNe”

3. Create an ability to edit a user in the table

    - Each user row should have an “edit” button, that will allow me to edit the user in a form

    - I should be able to cancel the editing, going back to the initial value

4. Create the ability to delete  a user

    - Each user row should have a “delete” button, that will allow me to delete a user from the table

    - The table should only be able to get back to the initial state after page refresh

  
  //
     I was trying to implement the search bar in the 1st table, but I couldn't make it work with property with the other features of the app. So, in the end, I took the safe and easy route and I create another table iteration only with the search bar feature.
     This was one of my first relatively more complex apps developed in React so I learned a lot, I enjoyed the challenge.   
  
  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
